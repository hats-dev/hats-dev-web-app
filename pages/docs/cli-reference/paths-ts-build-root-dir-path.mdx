# paths.ts-build-root-dir-path

The name of the folder that TypeScript should be treat as the root directory <u>**when building**</u> your project

## Default Value

`src/`

## Description

The value of this config is assigned to the `compilerOptions.rootDir` property in your `tsconfig-build.json` file.

If you decide to change this value, follow these guidelines:

1. You **must** also update your [`paths.ts-build-exclude-paths`](/docs/cli-reference/paths-ts-build-exclude-paths/) value
1. You **must not** use a name that collides with an existing directory in your project, such as `dist/` or `tests/`
1. You **should** use a descriptive name such as `ts/` to indicates that the folder contains your TypeScript source code

## Example Update

```
$ hats config paths.ts-build-root-dir-path "ts/"
```
