# Welcome to Happy TypeScript!

Let's change your TypeScript programming from ðŸ˜¢ to ðŸ˜Ž

## Quick Start

1. Ensure your machine has the necessary [System Requirements](/docs/system-requirements) configured

2. **Globally** install the <a target="_blank" href="https://npmjs.com/package/hats-cli">HaTs CLI</a>

```bash
npm i -g hats-cli
```

3. Bootstrap your project

```bash
hats create my-ts-library
```

## Background

Creating your first large TypeScript library from scratch is daunting and time consuming, even for experienced programmers. In order to make the most of the rich TypeScript ecosystem in your projects, you, at minimum, must have the following in place:

1. **Global environment (i.e. Machine-level) configuration**
1. **Local environment (i.e. Project-level) configuration**
1. **Organization for your directories and files**
1. **Safeguards against bugs and inconsistent style**
1. **Automations for version releases**

Only after these pre-requisites are set up, and working in concert, can you make progress on your problem domain. Happy TypeScript (aka `HaTs`) dramatically speeds up this process.

For more background on why and how HaTs came to be, check out this <a target="_blank" href="https://themackbook.com/blogs/introducing-hats">blog post</a>.

## Use Case for HaTs

HaTs helps you bootstrap **server-side TypeScript libraries** that target NodeJS runtimes.

Frontend projects, e.g. React sites, are beyond the scope of HaTs. If you're looking to write a TypeScript app for the frontend, good HaTs alternatives include <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript">create-next-app</a> and <a  target="_blank" href="https://tsdx.io">tsdx</a>, just to name a few.

## Note for Windows and Linux users

Currently only MacOS is officially supported.

Official Windows and Linux support is releasing ASAP. Follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/happytypescript">HaTs Twitter account</a> to stay updated.
