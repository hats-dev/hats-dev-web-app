# Bootstrap a Project

Run the `create` command to bootstrap your local and remote repos.

## Interactive Setup (Default)

```bash
hats create my-cool-lib
```

## Instant Setup

The `-y` flag instructs HaTs to skip prompts and scaffold your project according to your machine's git configs and HaTs configs. To learn more about the configuration resolution heuristic, refer to the [`hats config` CLI reference](/docs/cli-reference/config).

```bash
hats create -y my-cool-lib
```

## Usage Notes

### Target Directory

Execute `hats create` from the directory that you want to be the **parent directory** of your TypeScript project, e.g:

```bash
cd ~/programming/typescript-projects
hats create my-cool-lib
```

The HaTs CLI scaffolds a new folder that contains your TypeScript project inside your current directory. It does **not** turn your current directory into the project (similar to the way that commands such as `npm init` behave for instance).
