# Prepping Releases

Autogenerate a changelog with the command `auto-changelog -p`&#8224;

<h6 style="text-align: right">&#8224; global npm install required</h6>

## Implementation

The recommended changelog generator for HaTs projects is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-changelog">auto-changelog</a>.

Once you're ready to cut a new release, this program references the set of git commits that have occurred since you released the last version of your project. This information is organized and formatted into a `CHANGELOG.md` file at the root of your project.

**Pro Tip**: Writing quality commit messages and adhering to Semantic Versioning conventions will both increase the quality of your changelog.
