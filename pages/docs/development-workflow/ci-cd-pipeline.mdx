# CI/CD Pipeline

_"The difference between a senior engineer and a junior engineer is that a senior engineer is obsessed with automation."_

## Overview

Once you're happy with a set of local changes and ready to [push to your remote](/docs/development-workflow/syncing-changes) or [cut a new release](/docs/development-workflow/publishing) for publication, it's critical that your pipeline take the error-prone / repetitive work off your plate.

HaTs provides an intuitive starting point for CI/CD. This design saves you time and enables you focus solely on writing your new features and unit tests.

| Task                                         | Node Modules / Command Line Tools |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 🧯 Test &#10549;                             | ts-jest                           |
| ⚖️ Lint &#10549;                             | @typescript-eslint/parser         |
| 📐 Enforce Style &#10549;                    | prettier                          |
| 📝 Prep for Release&#8224; &#10549;          | auto-changelog + doctoc           |
| ♻️ Sync Local Changes to the Remote &#10549; | git + gh cli                      |
| 🎁 Build&#8224; &#10549;                     | tsc                               |
| 🚀 Publish&#8224;                            | npm                               |

## Executing CI/CD Tasks

In HaTs projects, the package.json `scripts` property contains the implementation details for each of these CI/CD tasks:

- Shell command
- Triggers
- Invocation cadence

To execute any of these CI/CD tasks from the command line simply use the `npm run X` syntax.
