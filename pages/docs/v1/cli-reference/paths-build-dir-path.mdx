# paths.build-dir-path

The name of your build directory

> **Note**: The value of this config is included in your project's `.ignore` files that control the behavior of git, ESLint, and Prettier. Therefore, it is not recommended to change this setting after you've started a project.

## Default Value

`dist/`

## Description

The value of this config is assigned to the `compilerOptions.outDir` property in your `tsconfig.json` file.

If you decide to change this value, follow these guidelines:

1. You **must** also update [`paths.main-module-path`](/docs/v1/cli-reference/paths-main-module-path) and [`paths.types-dts-path`](/docs/v1/cli-reference/paths-types-dts-path)
1. You **must not** use a name that collides with an existing directory in your project, such as `src/` or `tests/`
1. You **should** use a descriptive name such as `lib/` or `public/` to indicates that the folder contains your compiled JavaScript files

## Example Update

```
$ hats config paths.build-dir-path "lib/"
```
