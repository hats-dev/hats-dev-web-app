# paths.ts-build-exclude-paths

Glob patterns that TypeScript should exclude when compiling your project

> **Note**: To update this value, provide your Glob patterns as a comma separated list.

## Default Value

`tests`,`src/**/*.test.ts`

## Description

The value of this config is assigned to the `exclude` property in your `tsconfing-build.json` file.

Typically, you should **only** change this value:

1. In tandem with an update to your [`paths.ts-build-root-dir-path`](/docs/cli-reference/paths-ts-build-root-dir-path) config
1. In order to add additional glob patterns for your test files

## Example Update

```
$ hats config paths.ts-build-exclude-paths "tests,src/**/*.test.ts,src/**/*.spec.ts"
```
