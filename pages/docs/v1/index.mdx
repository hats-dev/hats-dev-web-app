## Quick Start

1. Ensure your machine has the necessary [System Requirements](/docs/v1/system-requirements) configured

2. **Globally** install the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://npmjs.com/package/hats-cli">HaTs CLI</a>

```bash
npm i -g hats-cli
```

3. Bootstrap your project

```bash
hats create my-ts-library
```

## Background

Creating your first large TypeScript library from scratch is daunting and time consuming, even for experienced programmers. In order to make the most of the rich TypeScript ecosystem in your projects, you, at minimum, must have the following in place:

- Global environment (i.e. _machine-level_) configuration
- Local environment (i.e. _project-level_) configuration
- Organization for your directories and files
- Safeguards against bugs and inconsistent style
- Automations for version releases

Only after these pre-requisites are set up, and working in concert, can you make progress on your problem domain.

This is where **HaTs** (short for _Happy TypeScript_) comes in.

## Use Case for HaTs

HaTs is a command line tool for TypeScript authors that preconfigures your TS projects for a smooth development workflow.

Its goal is to **save you precious dev time** and **protect your mental real estate**.

> **Note**: Currently, HaTs can only be used to create TypeScript libraries that target _server-side NodeJS_. Frontend projects, e.g. React sites, are not supported yet.

If you're looking to write TypeScript for frontend, good HaTs alternatives include <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/v1/basic-features/typescript">create-next-app</a> and <a  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tsdx.io">tsdx</a>, just to name a few.

## Windows and Linux users

Currently only MacOS is tested and officially supported. Official Windows and Linux support is releasing ASAP.
