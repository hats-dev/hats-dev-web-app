# Syncing Changes

Sync local changes to your remote with the command `npm run sync`

`package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "validate": "git pull --ff-only && npm i && npm run test && npm run lint",
  "stage-local-changes": "doctoc . && npm run prettify && git add .",
  "push-local-changes": "git push && git push --tags",
  "presync": "npm run validate",
  "sync": "npm run stage-local-changes && git commit",
  "postsync": "npm run push-local-changes",
  // ...
}
```

## Implementation

HaTs projects are pre-configured to run your [Testing](/docs/v1/development-workflow/testing), [Linting](/docs/v1/development-workflow/linting), and [Style Enforcement](/docs/v1/development-workflow/enforcing-style) CI Tasks before **each** commit that you execute via `npm run sync`.

`}
/>

This workflow carries countless benefits, most notably:

- Your project always maintains a healthy master branch.
- Resolving merge conflicts is as fast and painless as possible.
